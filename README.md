# Idea Vulnerability Scanner Plugin
## ARCHIVED in favour of the LSP derivative [Vuln-LSP](https://www.github.com/doddi/vuln-lsp)

Scanning configuration has options for:
- [Sonatype Nexus IQ Server](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-iq-server) scans for policy violations with remediation recommendations
- [OSS Index](http://ossindex.sonatype.org) to determine vulnerabilities brought into your code

Any violations discovered will appear at the package level within the editor.

## OSS Index
Violation information can be seen by way of highlighting packages (underscore in red) at the location the vulnerable component has been imported

## Nexus IQ Server
The Nexus IQ Server additionally benefits from identifying the threat level as can be seen in the following picture. Blue, Orange and Red underscore indicates an increasing threat level respectively.
Each threatlevel can be configured to be hidden, additionally the tooltip offers remediation advice.
